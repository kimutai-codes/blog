# Hi👋🏾 I'm Allan Kimutai

Welcome to my online repository of ever evolving personal thoughts, lessons, contemplations

## Now

I'm currently a student KCA university ,Kenya, pursuing Software Development.

I always desire to learn new technology and apply it however I can.I code, self taught, and I dream to always apply it creatively,happily and productively and (hopefully) not in the confines of a cubicle.I take projects😁 and I would be honored to build you and/or your organization a website or app.

I'm a follower of Christ, a student of life, explorer, adventurer and an artist.I'm also a victim of my ego, indiscipline and I rejoice for the Lord helps me fight my will daily and perfects me.
