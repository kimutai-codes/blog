> Be it that when we suffer, we suffer less stupidly

Hello,
I'm Kimutai

Welcome to my repository of personal thoughts, lessons and answers to many stupid questions I will always ask

## Now

I'm currently a student KCA university ,Kenya, pursuing software development.

I always desire to learn new technology and apply it however I can.I code, self taught, and I dream to always apply it creatively,happily and productively and not in the confines of a cubicle

I'm a indie hacker, and a indie lurker on the indie hacker community forum

Existence.I'm trynna make sense of it all

I'm wondering if what society tells me makes sense.Is it really good for me? why has it failed so much? Who's pulling the strings? What do I want? Do I have the stomach and discipline get what I really want? Or am I gonna be another victim of society!

## More about me

I'm a follower of Christ, a student of life, an artist and a creator.I'm also a victim of my ego, indiscipline and fear.

> _The slugard says, "There is a lion outside! I'll be killed in the public square!"_ -Solomon in Proverbs 22:13(NIV)

I love to ask questions and understand whatever interests me.There is always beauty in knowing and even more in knowing the uncommon.There is joy in seeking wonder.

> there is beauty in what you don't understand...oh the joy of wonder

I love life,conversations, authenticity and wisdom

> _Wisdom is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her_ - King Solomon in Proverbs 3:15(NIV)

I'm human .I bleed.I smile.I cry.I fall I rise.I learn âœ¨

I desire to know how to suffer less stupidly and to do life better - just like you.

I post the notes from those stupid questions here and I hope you take away something.Progress is tangible.Illusive, but tangible

I'm figuring out how to suffer less stupidly and do life better.Take a look and see the scars and trophies I've won on this journey...and of cause the notes to my questions ðŸ˜‰
