## More reasons to avoid CCM

1. Major sources **sources are apostate churches** most of which practice the occult and new age beliefs
2. **False teachings** and **heresy** are the main ingredients.
3. **It is emotionally manipulative**.This is what makes some think it's the Holy Spirit "moving" while in reality it is music manipulation.Some preachers use this to hypnotize and others can't function without it themselves.
4. It is deeply **affiliated with the one church movement.**

 It should not be a surprise that most CCM musicians are leaving the faith, and source churches going apostateðŸ˜ª I can boldly say most were never even in the faith.These are the results of watered down gospel and unwatched doctrine.

## Choosing good christian music

> Every song and every singer should be held to the same doctrinal standards as every preacher and every sermon - [Spencer Smit](https://youtu.be/Eq8jGpBYsKU)

Everything I would recommend, and more, is already mentioned in this video.I highly recommend this channel too.They have covered most things that are ailing Christianity today and it will save you a ton of research time.You should also [Watch "Third Adam" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnMpfoxYSFY&list=PLYltRndgBlAu-bP_2dLU24Ag-3SkrBHTe)- an eye-opening documentary they've done.

There are those who claim that you should know how to "chew the meat and spit out the fat".It is convincing but you'll realize it does not work.I'm speaking from experience here.When someone has consistent error in doctrine, you should leave them immediately (*Romans 16:17)*. I'm referring to both musicians and teachers.You can't keep listening to bad doctrine claiming you'll know what to take.Relying on yourself can really cost you down the road. I've learnt that it is better to be safe than sorry.

What about music for entertainment? 

It would be hard to consume let alone entertain yourself with heresy once you know this.

## What I listen to now

Old hymns are really edifying. **I've never had music this good**...and yes I'm 21ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

We should avoid any form of compromise brethren.These are perilous times.

Get started with this playlist if you use Spotify.

I also have a East African Gospel songs from my parents, most of them are offline tho.I'll link them as soon as I create and online playlist.

I tell you they don't make gospel music like they used to.Most are after wealth and fame.Most ain't singing for Jesus.

**The're a huge price for compromise**.We really really need read our Bibles and measure everything by it.If there's any deviation, tackle it according to what the word says.It is the only way to be safe in this wicked generation.
