> Sexual sin can be brought about by unhealed emotional wounds?😲

On the 7th of November 2021, my perspective on sexual immorality and the pursuit of sexual purity shifted for good..I see it now from a different angle and it's beautiful.**Healing emotional wounds can get us closer to the goal of raising a sexual-purity oriented generation**.I had to launch this blog early so that you can get educated on this too🥳🥳

[Ernest Wamboye](https://www.penstrokes.co.ke/author/ernest/) was the speaker of the day.And my my, he truly is blessed.A heaven sent gift to this generation.The way he shed light on this topic was life changing ✨

> **Disclaimer**: This is but a recollection of what I learnt. I've added my own insights and these are **not the original words of the speaker**.

He started where I never expected he would.He started by reading **Mark 1:11(NIV)**: *And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”* I almost asked if I was in the right hall😂😂

In this scripture, God the Father shows **acceptance** to Jesus when he tells him **"You are my Son"**.He **affirms** him saying **"whom I love"** and **appreciates** him when he says **"With whom I am well pleased"**...I don't know if you are blown away by this exposition of the word as I was.I still am to this day.Wow🔥🔥

The speaker taught us that this scripture contains all we need to live a life where we are content, full of confidence and self-esteem.A life which it will be hard to fall into sexual immorality, drug abuse, worthless friendships and many more things youth go through.Our focus however, was sexual purity.He started with the psychological reasons why many, including Christians, still struggle with sexual sin.

**Acceptance**, **affirmation** and **appreciation** are core psychological needs.Everyone needs them and always craves them.They should primarily come from our fathers (or guardian father figure).If our fathers do not give them to us, we face a lot of issues without knowing where they stem from.Without them we feel the opposite.**Instead of feeling accepted**, **we fell rejected**.**Instead of feeling affirmed**, **we feel scorned** and **instead of feeling appreciated, we feel we are taken for granted**.Without them we walk around with what is called a [father wound](https://danielpassini.org/father-wound/).A deep emotional wound that causes feelings of emptiness, and we find ourselves looking for acceptance, affirmation and appreciation from anywhere and anyone.

As we crave these needs, people come in our lives offering them especially in our teens and we fall for them and submit to their demands as they seem to have everything we need.People doing drugs look cool and warm and when you do drugs with them.They don't hesitate to tell you "I'm proud of you man".Also, when you consume erotic media, that actor never scorns you.Girl, if you suffer this wound,when and that boy comes and tells you "You are beautiful" or  "I love you" you feel like you have the whole world.You won't even take a second to ask question their intentions..(despite it being almost normal these days).I'm not justifying any of these behaviors, but it really is not our fault.We are just looking to be filled from the wrong place.

The speaker also educated us on the science of sexual addiction.This was also eye opening.

## The science of sexual addiction; especially when it's illicit

I learnt that there are many hormones and chemicals that makes sex addictive almost immediately you discover its wonder.

**Dopamine:** this is a chemical that plays a role of how we fell pleasure.I makes the activity pleasurable.The more you indulge in the pleasurable activity, the more dopamine is released in your brain and thus the more frequently you seek the activity.Before you know it, you are hooked💔

**Norepinephrine:** is also released, creating alertness and focus. It is the brain’s version of adrenaline. It tells the brain, “Something is about to happen, and we need to get ready for it.”

**Oxytocin:** this hormone bonds you with the experience and makes you feel it is part of you.

I learnt that **our sexual desire is very very okay** (first day I was convinced to be honest), but it's disastrous  when we yield to the demands of this flesh.Sex is only safe only in the confines of marriage, where God intended it to be.Sexual pleasure outside confines of marriage brings destruction.It causes things like sexual addiction, sexual abuse,guilt, shame,etc

## Healing and overcoming

The speaker also took us through a session of healing where we forgave those who have wronged us, those who took advantage of us and prayed against negative words spoken against us and also prayed to be released from sexual ties and much more.I cannot take you though a healing process myself, yet, but at least I have sensitized you on this matter and sparked you to seek to be healed of your wounds.Pray about it first and start seeking help and resources concerning this.

There is only one way to get filled, to always fell **accepted**, **affirmed** and **appreciated** (**to get healed**) all the time and that way is Christ.Then by reading the word we get to know what God says of us.What He thinks of and and much much more.Have him break every chain in your life today.

For all in Christ, our father in heaven calls us Son *(John 1:12)* and through the revelation of his word, he affirms us, and appreciates us.In him we never lack *(Psalm 23:1)*.He calls us his own.He really loves us..so much that he sent his only son to die on the cross so as you and I would be connected back to him, by believing in Christ *(John 3:16)*.Our father in heaven loves us just for being us..what did we ever do to deserve his love? Nothing..he gives it to us freely.

How do we live sexually pure lives? The sure answer is also Christ and seeking to understand the word that will truly set us free..*John 8:31-32*

If you have not yet accepted Christ in your life, you can do that today.To receive Christ, pray this prayer, believing in your heart that Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins and on the third day, he rose from the dead.

> Lord Jesus, I need you.Thank you for dying on the cross for my sins.I open the door of my life and receive you as my Savior and Lord.Thank you for forgiving my sins and giving me eternal life; take control of the throne of my life.Make me the kind of person you want me to be.Amen

Now then followers of Christ, desire the word *(1 Peter 2:2)*.As a true disciple, abide in the Word of God..it will teach you the truth and the truth shall set you free *(John 8:31-32)*. it sanctifies us each time we read *(John 17:17)* , renews our minds and transforms us *(Romans 12:1-2)*.We especially need our minds renewed so as to lead a life that pleases God.That's why we must read the word regularly and seek understanding from the Holy Spirit.The word will separate us from any patterns that lead us to sin.

I've learnt that we need to get educated on these matters and get more information.People suffer for lack of knowledge.Don't be afraid to seek help.It will be the wisest thing you'll ever do.

The speaker has more resources on sexual purity (awesome books and blog posts) and you can check [](https://www.penstrokes.co.ke/author/ernest/)them out on [his website](https://www.penstrokes.co.ke/author/ernest/).You will really be blessed✨

My biggest takeaway from this talk was that **our** **wounds can cause a ton of problems** in our lives even without our knowledge and sexual sin is one of them.I'm so happy to know they exist now.I can tell you for sure this is what the Lord is communicating to me.Prior to this talk, I did not know such wounds exist and almost every fellowship I've gone to this month has touched on it.This talked has set in motion my healing journey. I tell you it is beautiful...I'll be posting on the same soon and I do hope that you start examining yourself and get started on yours

I want to thank [Deliverance Church Umoja](https://dcumoja.org/) for organizing such events as **The Plus One Experience**.hey are really beneficial to the youth.

This was the first part of this discussion and the second will be held at the same place, **Deliverance Church Umoja Gangundo rd campus** on **5th Dec** from 3 PM.Pastor T will be the speaker.Purpose to attend.Itakujenga mbaya
