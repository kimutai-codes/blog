Mark 1:11
You are my son - Acceptance
Acceptance shakes your cause

Whom I love - Affirmation (the opposite is scorned)

With you I'm well pleased - Appreciation (the opposite is being taken for granted)

These are basic human needs and they need to be given.The only person with the ability to fill

Appreciating Him for who is.People want to be appreciated for what they have done and for being who they are

Acceptance, Affirmation and Appreciation should all come from a father and if not, the children will have father wounds.Father wounds bring a lot of issues in life.One such issue is the slavery to sexual desires and immorality

The children can easily find themselves trapped in sexual manipulation and addiction as they seek to be accepted, affirmed and appreciated.They long for them subconsciously and when someone comes in their life offering them, they are easily fooled into submitting themselves and being lured into sex(esp teen sex).This also happens in the case of porn.Many young men are addicted to it because; They never feel rejected, taken for granted or scorned when consuming such media and before they know it, they're in too deep and it becomes had to get out

Father wound - you'll start crying out for these when a father don't give them to you

Everyone needs appreciation

The science of addiction, The science of sexuality esp when it's illicit

These hormones and chemicals that are released into your brain and make you keep going back for more.

 dopamine : - this chemical creates an unnatural high.The more you indulge, the more is released and the more you need it thus making you go back to where you got it
 Neuropinephrine :
 oxytocin - this hormone bonds you with the experience and it sorta becomes part of who you are
 Delta force B - protein : Creates compulsive disorders.This is the reason why sth tells you "lets do it now".Like you cant go a minute without it.Makes you just wanna do it ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
Healing

You must be filled from the right source..Our Father in Heaven.From the only source that can fill you up to full capacity
To be healed from your deep father wounds, including wounds caused by past pains, you need to seek God.
You will then avoid situations where you're drained.Avoid places where you are constantly feeling rejected, scornned or taken for granted
Jesus got filled that he overcame all
When you're filled,

It heps you forgive
Make right decisions
Makes you choose life
You can always go back to him when life drains you

When you get into marriage;

You realize your spouse is a very selfish person
You realize that you're also selfish
Your spouse makes the same discovery
Then you start fighting
When you start fighting, these items come back full
When you get into marriage when filled, you are refined
