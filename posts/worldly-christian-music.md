Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) is the sensual music that has taken over the playlists of Churches, Christians, "Christians" and the world in the name of Gospel Music.It is that familiar Christian rock, rap, etc...worldly music with Christian badges and vocabulary.

There's no such thing as Christian rap,rock,etc.. it is all worldly music with Christian vocabulary.

There's a claim that it is relevant for our generation but I think it is wise to stay away from worldly things.Don't defile yourself in the name of relevance!

Noo...being worldly will not bring the world to Christ! it will do the opposite instead.We can already see more Christians are become worldly because of such illusions.

**It is Satan's master tool for spreading heresy!**

When I found CCM, I loved it because it sounded good, familiar to the ear and is popular.**The flesh just loves that stuff**.It is such a snare.Before long I was listening to pure rap while lying to myself that "I'll find soft ones" and I was becoming worldly day by day.I thank God I quit it.CCM was suble however.I did not know it was even the cause.It was flying under my radar till December though.

How did I quit CCM? I can only say it has been God.I suddenly found it very repulsive.So much that I went without music for like 3 days.I would hit play and turn it off barely a song later.I thank God so much for His mercy and care.

What triggered me to research was a comment from a brother in Christ that this music is demonic and by just searching it, his claim was more than confirmed.

**This music is dangerous**

It has demonic roots for the most part.
