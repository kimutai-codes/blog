Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) is the sensual music that has taken over the playlists of Churches, Christians, "Christians" and the world in the name of Gospel Music.It is the familiar Christian rock, rap, etc...worldly music with Christian badges and vocabulary.

There's no such thing as Christian rap,rock,etc..this is but worldly music with Christian vocabulary.

There's a claim that it is relevant for our generation.Which is better though.Relevance or holiness.Don't defile yourself in the name of relevance!

Noo...being worldly will not bring the world to Christianity, it will do the exact opposite.You can already see more Christians are becoming worldly because of such illusions and music is at the chief cause of that.

**It is Satan's master tool for spreading heresy!**

When I found CCM, I loved it because it sounded good, familiar to the ear and is popular.**The flesh just loves that stuff**.It is such a snare.Before long I was listening to pure rap while lying to myself that "I'll find soft ones".It really stained me and I thank God I dumped it.CCM was flying under my radar till December though.It is so cunning and subtle(you know like who) .

How did I quit? I can only say it has been God.I suddenly found it very repulsive.So much that I went without music for like 3 days straight.I would hit play and turn it off barely a song later.I thank God so much for His mercy and care.

What triggered me to research was a comment from a brother in Christ that this music is demonic and by just searching it, his claim was more than confirmed.

CCM  is not music authored recently, but rather, a style/culture of Christian music...they call it "modern" but it's not ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.You'll know it by the type of beats.If it's using secular beats, avoid it.

**This music is dangerous**

It has demonic roots for the most part.

These are the reasons why it should be avoided.

1. Most of its **sources are apostate churches**(who have left the faith and are dabbling with new age beliefs and even Eastern religious beliefs and practices).
2. It mostly **spreads heresy(misleading doctrine)** which is risky esp for young Christians.
3. It is deeply **affiliated with the one church movement** (This will need its own article).
4. **It is worldly music** not only in its style of beats, but also in the fact that it gives attention to worldly things.This kind of music mostly focuses on the creature instead of the creator.
5. It returns or introduces believers to the secular world.The more you listen to it the more your taste for worldly music grows.

 It should not be a surprise that most CCM musicians are leaving the faith, and source churches going apostateðŸ˜ª I can boldly say most were never in the faith and I hope they turn to the faith.These are the results of watered down gospel and unwatched doctrine.

## Finding good christian music

> \[Spencer smith's quote on musicians' doctrine]

There are those who claim that you should know how to chew the meat and spit out the fat.It is convincing and you'll realize it does not work.I'm speaking from experience here.When someone has consistent error in doctrine, you should leave them immediately. I'm referring to both musicians and teachers.You can't keep listening to bad music saying I'll know what to take.That stems from self reliance which in my opinion is already pride.

The video below is the best resource I have found for this.I have no more to add.I highly recommend this channel too.He has covered most things that are ailing Christianity today and it will save you a ton of research time.Watch Adam - an eyeopening documentary they've done.

What about music for entertainment? 

It would be hard for a mature Christian or an informed young one to entertain themselves with bad doctrine or sin.Good music is still entertaining.I'm finding classical hymns really entertaining..and yes, I'm 21ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.Those old hymns are what I find make the most sense.

Let's be keen in matters God.There's a ton of false doctrine and music has proved to be the biggest vessel for spreading them.What we need is knowledge and understanding of the God's word*(the truth)* so as to be able to escape false doctrine.We really really need read our Bibles.It is the only way to be safe in this wicked generation

## What I listen to now

After searching so long for classical gospel music, I found really good music.Geat music and very rich lyrics.

I did not find it weird.I guess it was because i had searched for a long time and I knew it was the best option to keep listening to music. I've linked one of my favorite playlists below to get you started.Enjoy,

I also have a few offline East African Gospel songs.Most of these are from my childhood.
