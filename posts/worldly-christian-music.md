Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) is the sensual music that has taken over the playlists of Churches, Christians, "Christians" and the world in the name of Gospel Music.It is that familiar Christian rock, rap, etc...worldly music with Christian badges and vocabulary.

There's no such thing as Christian rap,rock,etc.. it is all worldly music with Christian vocabulary.

There's a claim that it is relevant for our generation but I think it is wise to stay away from worldly things.Don't defile yourself in the name of relevance!

Noo...being worldly will not bring the world to Christ! it will do the opposite instead.We can already see more Christians are become worldly because of such illusions.

**It is Satan's master tool for spreading heresy!**

When I found CCM, I loved it because it sounded good, familiar to the ear and is popular.**The flesh just loves that stuff**.It is such a snare.Before long I was listening to pure rap while lying to myself that "I'll find soft ones" and I was becoming worldly day by day.I thank God I quit it.CCM was suble however.I did not know it was even the cause.It was flying under my radar till December though.

How did I quit CCM? I can only say it has been God.I suddenly found it very repulsive.So much that I went without music for like 3 days.I would hit play and turn it off barely a song later.I thank God so much for His mercy and care.

What triggered me to research was a comment from a brother in Christ that this music is demonic and by just searching it, his claim was more than confirmed.

**This music is dangerous**

It has demonic roots for the most part.

## More reasons to avoid CCM

1. Major sources **sources are apostate churches** most of which practice the occult and new age beliefs
2. **False teachings** and **heresy** are the main ingredients.
3. **It is emotionally manipulative**.This is what makes some think it's the Holy Spirit "moving" while in reality it is music manipulation.Some preachers use this to hypnotize and others can't function without it themselves.
4. It is deeply **affiliated with the one church movement.**

 It should not be a surprise that most CCM musicians are leaving the faith, and source churches going apostateðŸ˜ª I can boldly say most were never even in the faith.These are the results of watered down gospel and unwatched doctrine.

## Choosing good christian music

> Every song and every singer should be held to the same doctrinal standards as every preacher and every sermon - [Spencer Smit](https://youtu.be/Eq8jGpBYsKU)

Everything I would recommend, and more, is already mentioned in this video.I highly recommend this channel too.They have covered most things that are ailing Christianity today and it will save you a ton of research time.You should also [Watch "Third Adam" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnMpfoxYSFY&list=PLYltRndgBlAu-bP_2dLU24Ag-3SkrBHTe)- an eye-opening documentary they've done.

There are those who claim that you should know how to "chew the meat and spit out the fat".It is convincing but you'll realize it does not work.I'm speaking from experience here.When someone has consistent error in doctrine, you should leave them immediately (*Romans 16:17)*. I'm referring to both musicians and teachers.You can't keep listening to bad doctrine claiming you'll know what to take.Relying on yourself can really cost you down the road. I've learnt that it is better to be safe than sorry.

What about music for entertainment? 

It would be hard to consume let alone entertain yourself with heresy once you know this.

## What I listen to now





Old hymns are really so edifying. **I've never had music this good**...and yes I'm 21ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

We should avoid any form of compromise brethren.These are perilous times *\[[verse]]*

Get started with this playlist if you use Spotify.

I also have a East African Gospel songs from my parents, most of them are offline tho.I'll link them as soon as I create and online playlist.

I tell you they don't make gospel music like they used to.Most are after wealth and fame.Most ain't singing for Jesus.

**The're a huge price for compromise**.We really really need read our Bibles and measure everything by it.If there's any deviation, tackle it according to what the word says.It is the only way to be safe in this wicked generation.
