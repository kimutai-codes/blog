Bruuuh! there is a lot to music.It is a slippery slope if you are not watchful of the music you consume.Let this be a precursor of our future discussions on it

CCM is the music that has recently found its way into church.It sounds like worldly music.It is   mostly christianized  secular music - secular music with a little christian vocabulary.It is "danceable" and entertaining(even playable in clubs).It sounds great to the flesh.The music that I used to listen to a few weeks ago.

This type of music sounds really good.Accomodative, soft, aah what could a baby christian and x rapper want?Those minutes on the picture above are mostly CCM between April and Nov 2021 aloneðŸ˜²

CCM  however is not necessarily music authored recently, but rather, a style/ culture of christian music.You'll be surprised CCM dates way back and is  gradually being accepted in most churches.

We Christians have varied views and understanding of certain things, music being one of them.I do not want to hurt your freedom in Christ and neither I do not want to dictate to you what is right or wrong.I do not want to play the Holy Spirit in you (as [Allen Parr](https://www.youtube.com/user/thebeatagp) likes to say).Having said this, I'll just give you a few pointers as to why you should be careful with CCM

1. **It is worldly music**, not only in its style of beats but also in the fact that it gives attention to worldly things.This kind of music focuses mostly on self(me,me,me) instead of the creator.It feels good to the flesh.I does not convict of sin, it barely  paints a picture of who Jesus is as it focuses on me me me, (the Lord is going to bless me, I will be blessed this year, this is my year, I'm getting this I'm getting that).This music mostly leaves you the same spiritually if not worse.I have heard this music played in clubs and people lift their drinking vessels to them, singing in unison.If it is not edifying, is it worth it?
2. It is deeply **affiliated with the one church movement**(This will need its own article)
3. Most of its **sources are apostate churches**(who have left the faith and are babbling with new age beliefs and even eastern religion beliefs and practices)
4. It mostly **spreads heresy(misleading doctrine)** which is risky esp for young Christians.We need to be careful what we consume from men.
5. It returns or introduces believers to the secular world.You listen to CCM, then you start being tolerant to cellular music, you search for a songs with stronger beat and before you know it, you're dancing to dancehall and rapping to cecular music -  this has happened to me actually

Question; why are so many CCM artists leaving the faith?

## Seeking Alternatives

Three weeks ago, my taste for music drastically changed.I found my favorite upbeat and trendy music utterly repulsive that I quit music for like two days and  even deleted my liked songs to start afresh.A strange thing also happened after those two days.Out of the blue, as I was chatting with brother of mine,  he told me that there is something terribly wrong with Christian music.This is when I officially started being cautious of it.Curiosity hit and I started researching music and maan ain't its skeletons ugly!! I even went without music the entire time

Those three weeks were not easy..I can live without music, but I felt there was something missing.Music for me is great when I'm up and about or working.It is handy when you do not have the bandwidth to consume any other material.I love music for its ability to keep me focused on Jesus in my busy hours.No wonder those three weeks were a struggle!

I thank God for the amount of information that we can access in this generation and especially for brethren who publish content on platforms such as YouTube and blogs.The resources that helped me find good sound christian music are [Allen Parr's video on CCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi4RADE4zL0) and [Colin Miller's video on alternatives to CCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI1ZApuG2Io)

## Setting out

As you set out to evaluate your music, start with these;

1. Ask God for guidance
2. Avoid listening to music that your conscience refutes
3. Read the word, so that you can be discerning enough and not be drowned in heresies (in music and even preaching)
4. Learn to distinguish worldly melodies from sacred melodies (the beats) - I'll write more on this in articles to come

I urge all brethren to be sensitive to these matters.There are many false doctrines even in the church and music might be the biggest vessel for spreading them.What we need is a knowledge and understanding of the God's word*(the truth)* so as to be able to escape false doctrine

The truth that I have lately come to cherish is that, God will never leave us - He will never let anyone take us away from His hand *(John 10:28)*.Nothing can separate us from His love *(Romans 8:38-39)* and he will never let us fall *(Jude 1:24)*.Not even this music will drown us  - however, lets seek to be safe as it can affect us  and deny us joy in Christ

**What I'm currently learning on music**

1. **Electronic distortion** from musical instruments and style( have you noticed the way the instrument players play the instruments kinda in an incremental way during worship? and then people say it is the power of God in the atmosphere? bare with my ignorance but also be glad that I'm setting out to know the truth)
2. Origins of music
3. Differentiating between worldly and sacred melodies
