Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) is the sensual music that has taken over the playlists of Churches, Christians, "Christians" and the world in the name of Gospel Music.It is that Christian rock, rock, etc...worldly music with Christian labels.

\[spencer smith's quote on musicians' doctrine]

CCM  is not music authored recently, but rather, a style/culture of Christian music...they call it "modern"ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.You'll be surprised how far back it dates.

**This music is dangerous**

These are the reasons why it should be avoided.

1. Most of its **sources are apostate churches**(who have left the faith and are dabbling with new age beliefs and even Eastern religious beliefs and practices).
2. It mostly **spreads heresy(misleading doctrine)** which is risky esp for young Christians.
3. It is deeply **affiliated with the one church movement** (This will need its own article).
4. **It is worldly music** not only in its style of beats, but also in the fact that it gives attention to worldly things.This kind of music mostly focuses on the creature instead of the creator.
5. It returns or introduces believers to the secular world.The more you listen to it the more your taste for worldly music grows.



Question: why are so many CCM artists and (even churches) leaving the faith? I can boldly say most were never in the faith and I hope they turn to the faith.These are the result of gospel no longer being preached.

## Seeking alternatives

Music is a daily part of most of us.It just has to be there.But it gets hard when the only music you could palete becomes repulsive? I quit music for like three weeks then started looking for a "fix"..or can you stay without music? It has taken a lot of trial and error but I finally found it

## Setting out

As you set out to evaluate your music, start with these;

1. Ask God for guidance
2. Read the word, so that you can be discerning enough and not be drowned in heresies (in music and even preaching)
3. Avoid listening to music that your conscience refutes
4. Learn to distinguish worldly melodies from sacred melodies (the beats) - I'll write more on this in articles to come

I urge all brethren to be sensitive to these matters.There are many false doctrines even in the church and music has proved to be the biggest vessel for spreading them.What we need is knowledge and understanding of the God's word*(the truth)* so as to be able to escape false doctrine.

My joy is in this, God will never leave His children - He will never let anyone take us away from His hand *(John 10:28)*.Nothing can separate us from His love *(Romans 8:38-39)* and He will never let us fall *(Jude 1:24)*.I am confident that not even this music will drown us.He will make us loose the taste for what is not trueðŸ¥³  - however, let us be cautious as it can affect us  and deny us joy in Christ
