Bruuuh! there is a lot to music.It is a slippery slope if you are not watchful of the music you consume.Let this be a precursor of our future discussions on it

CCM is the music that has recently found its way into church.These are the characteristics; It sounds like worldly music (dancehall, hiphop and rock music) - christian lyrics with secular beats (most common).It sometimes is christianized  secular music.Sometimes self exhorting music with a little christian vocabulary .It is "danceable" and entertaining(even playable in clubs).It sounds great to the flesh.This type of music sounds really good and familiar to most young believers,sometimes it has watered down doctrine and is soft .That's what a baby christian and x-rapper fell into.Those minutes on the picture above are mostly the CCM  I listened to between just April and Nov 2021ðŸ˜²

CCM  is not music authored recently, but rather, a style/culture of christian music...they call it "modern"ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.You'll be surprised how far back it dates except recently being adopted in most churches.

We Christians have varied views and understanding of certain things, music being one of them.Who am I to tell you what type of good music is good for you? I do not want to play the Holy Spirit in you, as [Allen Parr](https://www.youtube.com/user/thebeatagp) likes to say, but I'll just give you a few pointers as to why you should be careful with CCM

1. **It is worldly music**, not only in its style of beats but also in the fact that it gives attention to worldly things.This kind of music focuses mostly on self(me,me,me) instead of the creator.It feels good to the flesh.I does not convict of sin, it barely  paints a picture of who Jesus is as it focuses on me me me, (the Lord is going to bless me, I will be blessed this year, this is my year, I'm getting this I'm getting that).This music mostly leaves you the same spiritually if not worse.I have heard this music played in clubs and people lift their drinking vessels to them, singing in unison.If it is not edifying, is it worth it?
2. It is deeply **affiliated with the one church movement**(This will need its own article)
3. Most of its **sources are apostate churches**(who have left the faith and are babbling with new age beliefs and even eastern religion beliefs and practices)
4. It mostly **spreads heresy(misleading doctrine)** which is risky esp for young Christians.We need to be careful what we consume from men.
5. It returns or introduces believers to the secular world.You listen to CCM, then you start being tolerant to cellular music, you search for a songs with stronger beat(you sorta want to go to the source) and before you know it, you're dancing to dancehall and rapping to cecular music -  this has happened to me actually

Question: why are so many CCM artists and (even churches) leaving the faith?

## Seeking alternatives

Three weeks ago, my taste for music drastically changed.I found my favorite trendy upbeat music utterly repulsive that I did not play music for like two days and  even deleted my liked songs to start afresh.A strange thing also happened after those two days.Out of the blue, a brother of mine he told me that there is something terribly wrong with modern Christian music.This is when I officially started being cautious of it.Curiosity hit and I started researching music and maan ain't its skeletons ugly!! I have not been listening to much music these three weeks

It has not been easy though...I can live without music, but I felt there was something missing.Music for me is great when I'm up and about or working.It is handy when you do not have the bandwidth to consume any other material.I love music for its ability to keep me focused on Jesus even in my busy hours.No wonder those three weeks were a struggle!

I have been searching for alternatives and I'm glad I'm building a new playlist.I thank God for the amount of information that we can access in this generation and especially for brethren who publish content on platforms such as YouTube and blogs.The resources that helped me make decisions and find good sound christian music are [Allen Parr's video on CCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi4RADE4zL0) and [Colin Miller's video on alternatives to CCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI1ZApuG2Io).I highly recommend these videos.

I have also found that there is music with really good sound doctrine but secular beat.This type of music can be edifying.That's if you can survive the cringing due to the beat ...but if you are just fine with it, good for you...should I say you're lucky?ðŸ˜‚.May the Holy Spirit guide  you in this as in all things

## Setting out

As you set out to evaluate your music, start with these;

1. Ask God for guidance
2. Read the word, so that you can be discerning enough and not be drowned in heresies (in music and even preaching)
3. Avoid listening to music that your conscience refutes
4. Learn to distinguish worldly melodies from sacred melodies (the beats) - I'll write more on this in articles to come

I urge all brethren to be sensitive to these matters.There are many false doctrines even in the church and music has proved to be the biggest vessel for spreading them.What we need is knowledge and understanding of the God's word*(the truth)* so as to be able to escape false doctrine.

My joy is in this, God will never leave His children - He will never let anyone take us away from His hand *(John 10:28)*.Nothing can separate us from His love *(Romans 8:38-39)* and He will never let us fall *(Jude 1:24)*.I am confident that not even this music will drown us.He will make us loose the taste for what is not trueðŸ¥³  - however, let us be cautious as it can affect us  and deny us joy in Christ
