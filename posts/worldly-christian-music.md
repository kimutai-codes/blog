(testimony of how I found it and how it was and how i came to quit it)

Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) is the sensual music that has taken over the playlists of Churches, Christians, "Christians" and the world in the name of Gospel Music.It is the familiar Christian rock, rap, etc...worldly music with Christian badges and vocabulary.

CCM  is not music authored recently, but rather, a style/culture of Christian music...they call it "modern"ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.You'll be surprised how far back it dates.

**This music is dangerous**

It has demonic roots for the most part.

These are the reasons why it should be avoided.

1. Most of its **sources are apostate churches**(who have left the faith and are dabbling with new age beliefs and even Eastern religious beliefs and practices).
2. It mostly **spreads heresy(misleading doctrine)** which is risky esp for young Christians.
3. It is deeply **affiliated with the one church movement** (This will need its own article).
4. **It is worldly music** not only in its style of beats, but also in the fact that it gives attention to worldly things.This kind of music mostly focuses on the creature instead of the creator.
5. It returns or introduces believers to the secular world.The more you listen to it the more your taste for worldly music grows.

 It should not be a surprise that most CCM musicians are leaving the faith, and source churches going apostateðŸ˜ª I can boldly say most were never in the faith and I hope they turn to the faith.These are the results of watered down gospel and unwatched doctrine.

## Finding good christian music

> \[Spencer smith's quote on musicians' doctrine]

This video is the best resource I have found for this.I highly recommend his channel.He has covered most things that are ailing Christianity today and it will save you a ton of time.

What about music for entertainment? 

It would be hard for a mature Christian or an informed young one to entertain themselves with bad doctrine or sin.Good music is still entertaining.I'm finding classical hymns really entertaining..and yes, I'm 21ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.Those old hymns are what I find make the most sense.

Let's be keen in matters God.There's a ton of false doctrine and music has proved to be the biggest vessel for spreading them.What we need is knowledge and understanding of the God's word*(the truth)* so as to be able to escape false doctrine.We really really need read our Bibles.It is the only way to be safe in this wicked generation

## What I listen to now

After searching so long for classical gospel music, I found really good music.Geat music and very rich lyrics.

I did not find it weird.I guess it was because i had searched for a long time and I knew it was the best option to keep listening to music. I've linked one of my favorite playlists below to get you started.Enjoy,

I also have a few offline East African Gospel songs.Most of these are from my childhood.
