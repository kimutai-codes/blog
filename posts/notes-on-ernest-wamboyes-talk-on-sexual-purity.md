On the 7th of November 2021, my perspective on sexual immorality and the pursuit of sexual purity shifted for good..I see it now from a different angle and it's beautiful.Beautiful that I had to launch this blog before its date, so you get this message sooner🥳🥳

[Ernest Wamboye](https://www.penstrokes.co.ke/author/ernest/) was the speaker of the day.And my my, he truly is blessed.A heaven sent gift to this generation.The way he shed light on this topic was life changing ✨

He started where I never expected this topic to start.He started by reading **Mark 1:11(NIV)**: _And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”_ I almost asked if I was in the right hall😂😂

He then taught us that this scripture contains all we need to live a life where we are full of confidence and self esteem.A life which it will be hard to fall into sexual immorality, drug abuse, worthless friendships and many more things youth go through.Our focus however, was sexual purity.He started with the psychological

In this scripture, God the Father shows **acceptance** to Jesus when he tells him **"You are my Son"**.He **affirms** him by telling saying **"whom I love"** and **appreciates** him when he says **"With whom I am well pleased"**.I don't know if you are blown away by this exposition of the word as I was.Even to this day I still am.Wow🔥🔥

**Acceptance**, **affirmation** and **appreciation** are core psychological needs.Every man needs them and always craves them.They should primarily come from our fathers (or guardian father figure).If our fathers do not give them to us, we face a lot of issues without knowing where they stem from.Without them we feel the opposite.instead of feeling accepted, we fell rejected.Instead of feeling affirmed, we feel scorned and instead of feeling appreciated, we feel we are taken for granted.Without them we walk around with what is called a [father wound](https://danielpassini.org/father-wound/).A feeling of lack of love from the father in your life.

As we crave these needs, people come in our lives offering them especially in our teens.People doing drugs look cool and warm and when you do it with them, they don't hesitate to tell you "I'm proud of you".When you consume erotic media, that actor never scorns you.Girl, if suffer this wound,when and that boy comes and tells you "You are beautiful"/ "I love you" you feel like you have the whole world.Not even taking a second to ask if he even understands love or just trapping you.I'm not justifying any of this, but it really is not our fault.We are just looking to be filled from the wrong place.

He taught us that sex is an amazing and beautiful thing..that **our sexual desire is very okay okay**.This day he convinced me.The problem is, it becomes like a burden when not in the confines of marriage, where God intended it to be.Sex outside the confines of marriage brings destruction.Things like addiction, sexual abuse,guilt, shame,..you name it spring up

I am glad that you are still reading and that you are now sensitized on this matter.You now understand why you do/did certain things even though you most probably never liked them.You don't have to ask anymore.Let's keep reading

Finally, the speaker taught us the science of sexual addiction.This was also eye opening.

## The science of sexual addiction; especially when it's illicit

I learnt that there are many hormones and chemicals that makes sex addictive almost immediately you discover its wonder.

**Dopamine:** this is a chemical that plays a role of how we fell pleasure.I makes the activity pleasurable.The more you indulge in the pleasurable activity, the more dopamine is released in your brain and thus the more frequently you seek the activity.Before you know it, you are hooked💔

**Norepinephrine:** is also released, creating alertness and focus. It is the brain’s version of adrenaline. It tells the brain, “Something is about to happen, and we need to get ready for it.”

**Oxytocin:** this hormone bonds you with the experience and makes you feel it is part of you.

## Healing and overcoming

For all in Christ, our father in heaven calls us Son _(John 1:12)_ and through the revelation of his word, he affirms us, and appreciates us.In him we never lack _(Psalm 23:1)_.He calls us his own.He really loves us..so much that he sent his only son to die on the cross so as you and I would be connected back to him, by believing him _(John 3:16)_.Our father in heaven loves us for just being us..what did we ever do to deserve his love?Nothing..he gives it to us freely

There is only one way to get filled.To always fell accepted, affirmed and appreciated all the time and that way is Christ.Brethren I would love that you join us in reality.Come and know what God says of you.What he thinks of you.Have him break every chain in your life today.For this to happen, I urge you to take that bold step today to accept Jesus as the Lord and savior of your life..

To receive Christ today, pray this prayer.Believing in your heart that Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins and on the third day, he rose from the dead

> Lord Jesus, I need you.Thank you for dying on the cross for my sins.I open the door of my life and receive you as my Savior and Lord.Thank you for forgiving my sins and giving me eternal life; take control of the throne of my life.Make me the kind of person you want me to be.Amen

Now then followers of Christ, desire the word _(1 Peter 2:2)_.As a true disciple, abide in the Word of God..it will teach you the truth and the truth shall set you free _(John 8:32)_. it sanctifies us each time we read _(John 17:17)_ , renews our minds and transforms us _(Romans 12:2)_.The word will separate us from any patterns that lead us to sin.
